# 🌤️ EdgeCast-FL: Federated Learning for Local Weather Forecasting

**EdgeCast-FL** explores the implementation of **Federated Learning (FL)** for distributed weather prediction using edge-based sensor data. The system simulates decentralized environments where each client represents a local node, collaboratively training a global model without sharing raw data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a Federated Learning pipeline using the [Flower](https://flower.dev/) framework.
- Predict daily temperature using local weather data from Jakarta (2023–2024) (source:https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data/)
- Compare model performance in centralized vs federated settings.
- Analyze convergence behavior across IID and (future) non-IID data distributions.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- [Flower](https://flower.dev/) for Federated Learning orchestration
- Scikit-learn (ML models: MLPRegressor, LinearRegression)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks (for post-analysis)
- VS Code on Windows (local development)

## 🧠 Models Used

This project focuses on **regression-based temperature prediction** using the following models:

### 🔹 Centralized Baseline
- **Model**: Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPRegressor)
- **Input**: Daily weather features (e.g., date, temp_min, humidity, etc.)
- **Output**: Predicted temperature (next day)

### 🔹 Federated Learning Model
- **Same model architecture as baseline**
- Trained in a decentralized manner using:
  - **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** strategy
  - Flower framework for simulation

### 🔧 Model Notes
- MLP is selected based on initial performance testing (outperformed Linear Regression)
- Configurable hidden layers, activation functions, and learning rates
- Model evaluation is tracked using **RMSE** across multiple rounds

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv 
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows: 
source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux:

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Start the Federated Server
```
python fl/server.py
```

### 2. Launch Simulated Clients
```
python fl/run_simulation.py
```

### 3. Analyze Training Results
Open the analysis notebook:
```
notebooks/analyze_federated_logs.ipynb
```

---

## 📊 Analyze Results

After training, evaluation results and predictions are stored per client in `.csv` files inside the `logs/` directory.

You can perform:

- 📈 **Trend analysis**: RMSE per round across all clients
- 🎯 **Ideal round detection**: using slope or moving average heuristics
- 📊 **Prediction evaluation**: compare predicted vs actual temperature per client
- 🧪 **Error metrics**: MAE and RMSE comparison across clients
- 📉 **Visual analysis**: line charts and bar plots of model performance

### Tools Used
- **Notebooks**:
  - `notebooks/analyze_federated_logs.ipynb` – convergence & round trends
  - `notebooks/analyze_federated_predictions.ipynb` – prediction performance
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

The notebooks generate:
- RMSE curves over training rounds
- MAE/RMSE bar charts per client
- Actual vs Predicted temperature plots
- Summary tables and insight notes for further analysis

## 🔍 Future Work / To-do

Here are several planned extensions and experiments:

- 🔄 **Non-IID data simulation**  
  Clients will be assigned seasonal data (e.g. dry vs rainy periods)

- 🔁 **Strategy comparison**
  - FedAvg (current)
  - FedProx (to be added)
  - Other Flower-compatible strategies

- 📊 **Centralized vs Federated benchmarking**
  - Accuracy, convergence, stability

- 🌐 **Web dashboard integration**
  - Show RMSE trends
  - Notify on training completion

- ⚡ **Model variations**
  - Test Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM (future)
